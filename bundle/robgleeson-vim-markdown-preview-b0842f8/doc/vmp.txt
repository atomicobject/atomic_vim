*vmp.txt* Plugin for previewing markdown documents in the browser.

vim-markdown-preview is a customizable plugin for previewing markdown 
documents in the browser.

Through custom stylesheets, you can customize the HTML preview of a 
document, but defaults stylesheets are provided.

I'm a big GitHub user, so there is a stylesheet that styles a markdown 
document like it would appear on the GitHub website.

If you write your own stylesheet, please share it!
See http://github.com/robgleeson/vim-markdown-preview.
