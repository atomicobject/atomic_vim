CLOJURE						*clojure.vim* *ft-clj-syntax*

The clojure syntax highlighting provides two options:
>
	g:clj_highlight_builtins
		If it exists and is nonzero, then Clojure's builtin functions
		are highlighted. This useful to distuingish macros and special
		forms from functions.

	g:clj_highlight_contrib
		If it exists and is nonzero, then Clojure-Contrib's functions
		are highlighted.

	g:clj_paren_rainbow
		If it exists and is nonzero, then differing levels of
		parenthesisation will receive different highlighting.
<
The g:clj_paren_rainbow option provides 10 levels of individual colorisation
for the parentheses. Because of the quantity of colorisation levels, unlike
non-rainbow highlighting, the rainbow mode specifies its highlighting using
ctermfg and guifg, thereby bypassing the usual colorscheme control using
standard highlighting groups. The actual highlighting used depends on the
dark/bright setting  (see |'bg'|).
